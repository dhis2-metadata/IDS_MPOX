# Mpox Surveillance Toolkit

The ongoing global outbreak of Mpox, which began in May 2022, has necessitated a comprehensive approach to surveillance, case investigation, and contact tracing. The interim guidance provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) aims to manage and eventually eliminate human-to-human transmission of Mpox. This guidance is particularly relevant in light of the varied epidemiological patterns observed across different regions, including newly affected areas outside Africa, where the disease was traditionally endemic.

## Surveillance Objectives

- Detect new outbreaks and halt transmission to contain the global spread.
- Provide optimal clinical care and isolate cases to prevent further spread.

## Case Definitions

Suspected Case: Individuals presenting with unexplained acute rash or lesions and other specific symptoms, especially with a history of exposure to probable or confirmed cases.
Probable Case: Individuals with unexplained acute rash and epidemiological links to confirmed cases, or positive tests for orthopoxvirus.
Confirmed Case: Laboratory confirmation of Mpox virus (MPXV) infection through specific molecular tests.
Reinfection Cases: Defined by documented history of previous Mpox episodes, with clear criteria for distinguishing between new infections and recrudescence of prior infections.
Death Definition: A Mpox death for surveillance purposes is defined as a death in a probable or confirmed Mpox case, unless the alternative cause of death is clearly unrelated, such as trauma. In settings where laboratory confirmation is limited, deaths among suspected cases that are clinically compatible with Mpox are also considered Mpox deaths.

## Data Collection and Reporting

Consistent and timely reporting of probable and confirmed cases, with a focus on completeness and accuracy of demographic and clinical information.
Use of standardized forms (Case Reporting Form and Case Investigation Form) to ensure harmonized data collection across countries.

## Indicators for Monitoring
Indicators such as the timeliness of case reports, completeness of contact tracing, and proportion of confirmed cases with complete data are recommended to monitor the quality of surveillance and response efforts.

## Variables Suggested

- Demographic Information: Age, sex, gender, sexual behavior, and underlying health conditions.
- Clinical Data: Symptoms, date of onset, hospitalization status, and outcomes.
- Epidemiological Data: Contact history, travel history, exposure to animals, and mode of transmission.
- Laboratory Data: Results of PCR tests, genomic sequencing, and other relevant diagnostic tests.

## Reasoning and Considerations

- Accuracy and Timeliness: Timely identification and isolation of cases are crucial to preventing further spread. Using standardized case definitions ensures that cases are consistently identified and managed.
- Resource Allocation: Surveillance efforts should be adapted to the capacity of local health systems, with specific attention to high-risk areas and populations.
- Community and Health System Engagement: Collaboration between health authorities, community leaders, and event organizers is essential for effective contact tracing and public health messaging.

## Travel-Related Infections

## Animal Health and Monitoring of Zoonotic Infections

- Zoonotic Transmission: Mpox has long been considered a zoonotic disease, with animal-to-human transmission occurring primarily in parts of Africa where the virus is endemic. The ongoing global outbreak underscores the need to monitor potential zoonotic transmission routes more closely, especially in areas where human-animal contact is frequent.

- Animal Surveillance: Surveillance efforts should include collaboration with animal health authorities to investigate cases of Mpox in wildlife and domestic animals. Identifying and monitoring animal reservoirs and potential intermediate hosts is critical to preventing spillover events that can lead to human outbreaks.

- Exposure Investigation: When zoonotic transmission is suspected, detailed information on the type of animal, the nature of the contact, and the geographic location of the exposure should be collected. This data will help refine public health interventions aimed at reducing the risk of future zoonotic transmission.
Public Health Integration: Animal health data should be integrated into broader public health surveillance systems to allow for early detection of potential zoonotic outbreaks and to guide targeted interventions.

## Considerations for Population and Targets

- High-Risk Groups: Special attention is given to key populations, including men who have sex with men, sex workers, and individuals with compromised immune systems.
Endemic Areas: In areas where Mpox is traditionally endemic, the focus is on understanding and mitigating zoonotic transmission and managing human-to-human spread within these contexts.
- Global Targets: The overarching goal is to reduce and eventually eliminate human-to-human transmission, with progress monitored through a set of surveillance indicators and quality measures.
- Age groups: certain populations, such as children and adolescents, may be at particular risk, especially in endemic areas where animal-to-human transmission occurs. Children are noted as a vulnerable group in both endemic and non-endemic settings. In African settings where Mpox is endemic, children continue to be at risk, alongside adults, indicating that age-specific interventions may be necessary​
- Age-Related Data Collection: Surveillance efforts include collecting age-specific data as part of the demographic variables in the WHO's Case Reporting Form (CRF). This information is crucial for understanding how the disease affects different age groups and for monitoring shifts in the demographic distribution of cases
The guidance also suggests that shifts in the age distribution of cases should be closely monitored as a potential indicator of changes in transmission dynamics or disease severity​
